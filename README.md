pidgin-media-emblems-buildable
==============================

A fork of the pidgin-media-emblems plugin which actually contains a make file. Forked from here: http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-media-emblems/

To use, first make sure you have `gcc`, `git` (obviously) and `make` installed,
and then run these commands:

    git clone http://github.com/djhaskin987/pidgin-media-emblems-buildable
    cd pidgin-media-emblems-buildable
    make
    make install

You should instantly be able to see the "Media Emblems" plugin in your pidgin
plugins list.
